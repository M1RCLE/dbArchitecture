# Here is my project on theme "DB Architecture"

## I create imitation of Instagram DB in postgreSQL project is launchd in docker container with images of golang, prometeus, grafana and python (for garbage data generaton)
## Also there is some scripts that do some cool stuf
  one of them is a script that make a copy of DB for safety
  other one is a script that create a report about average time for query to execute (there were two versions of DB. One with indexes and one without. So I wanted to check speed of queries)
